It includes many in-built features such as creating a user schema to the database and also includes fetching and deleting. Unlike many other packages, this package includes easy to follow properties and methods so that you know where you can find them.

## Features
- 100% Promise-based package
- Easy to find properties and methods
- Included type declarations for TypeScript developers

## Examples
Import the discordjs-xp package:
```js
const DiscordXP = require("discordjs-xp"); // For commonjs
import DiscordXP from "discordjs-xp"; // For ES6 or higher
```

Initialise the discordjs-xp package:
```js
const xpClient = new DiscordXP("MongoDB URL"); // Create a new discordjs-xp instance
```

More examples:
```js
// Create a new user
xpClient.users.create({ guildId: "Guild ID", userId: "User ID" }).then(async (user) => {
    // When a user is created, the default level is 1 while the default XP is 0

    await user.xp.add(10); // Add 10 XP to the user
    await user.xp.subtract(10); // Subtract 10 XP from the user

    await user.levels.add(1); // Increase the users level by 1
    await user.levels.subtract(1); // Decrease the users level by 1
});

// Fetch an existing user from the database
xpClient.users.fetch({ guildId: "Guild ID", userId: "User ID" }).then(async (user) => {
    await user.xp.add(10); // Add 10 XP to the user
    await user.xp.subtract(10); // Subtract 10 XP from the user

    await user.levels.add(1); // Increase the users level by 1
    await user.levels.subtract(1); // Decrease the users level by 1
});

// Delete a user
xpClient.users.delete({ guildId: "Guild ID", userId: "User ID" });
xpClient.users.fetch({ guildId: "Guild ID", userId: "User ID" }).then(async (user) => await user.delete());
xpClient.users.create({ guildId: "Guild ID", userId: "User ID" }).then(async (user) => await user.delete());
```
